# Stable Diffusion on SMU HPC
There are 2 main HPC systems at SMU, powered by NVIDIA GPU:
- The ManeFrame 3: equipped with V100 (32gb), running under gpu-dev queue have the limited walltime of 2 hours
- The SuperPOD: equipped with A100 (82gb), have much longer walltime at 12 hours.
While it is straightforward to use Stable Diffusion UI directly using Virtual Desktop on ManeFrame 3, you also have an option to use the UI on SuperPOD using port-forwarding technique.

This material introduces both methods on how to install and run your Stable Diffusion UI on M3 and SPOD.

The topic covers the installation of:

  (1) Automatic1111
  
  (2) ComfyUI
  
  (3) InvokeAI
  
  (4) Fooocus

on ManeFrame 3 and SuperPOD
