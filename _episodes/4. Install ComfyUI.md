# 4. Install ComfyUI to M3

Alternative to Automatic1111, is ComfyUI which is an open source project and can be found from their github: [https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

The following steps instruct you to install it on SMU M3, after creating the conda env and activate it:

### Download the model (either by gitclone or download zip file from their repo):
I encourage you to download it to your $WORK folder since you have plenty of space (avoid the limitted $HOME storage):

```bash
$ cd $WORK
$ git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
$ cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
$ git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
```

### Run the GUI

```bash
$ cd $WORK/ComfyUI
$ python main.py
```

If you see the http link appear as in the screenshot below, copy it and paste to the **Chrome browser** from the Virtual Desktop:
