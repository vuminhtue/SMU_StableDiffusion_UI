# 3. Install Automatic1111 onto M3 with UI and GPU supported

One of the most popular UI for Stable Diffusion is Automatic1111 which is an open source project and can be found from their github: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

The following steps instruct you to install it on SMU M3, after creating the conda env and activate it in Step 1:

```bash
$ conda activate ~/sd
```

### Download the model (either by gitclone or download zip file from their repo):
I encourage you to download it to your $WORK folder since you have plenty of space (avoid the limitted $HOME storage):

```bash
$ cd $WORK
$ git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
```

### Next download one sample checkpoint (pre-trained model) for your usage.
I suggest to download one from [HuggingFace, runwayml](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- Navigate to https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
- Select **Files and versions**
- Right click and copy link address of the ckpt file

```bash
$ cd $WORK/stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion
$ wget https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt
```
You can download as many checkpoint in the format of **ckpt** or **safetensors** to the models folder for your usage.

### Run the executable: webui.sh

```bash
$ cd $WORK/stable-diffusion-webui
$ ./webui.sh
```
