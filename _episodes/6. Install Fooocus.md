# 5. Install Fooocus to M3

Foocus is open source package: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI

The following steps instruct you to install it on SMU M3, after creating the conda env and activate it in Step 1:

```bash
$ conda activate ~/sd
```

### Download the latest model (either by gitclone or download zip file from their repo):

I encourage you to download it to your $WORK folder since you have plenty of space (avoid the limitted $HOME storage):

```bash
$ cd $WORK
$ git clone https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus.git
```

### Run the installer

```bash
$ cd $WORK/Fooocus
$ python launch.py
```
