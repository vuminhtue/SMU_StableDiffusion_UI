# 9. Using SuperPOD 

The method of using conda environment in SuperPOD is similar to ManeFrame 3. These are the steps:

### 1. Setup your own conda environment in SuperPOD with cuda library supported (refer to my SuperPOD 101 lecture notes)
### 2. Install the Stable Diffusion UI model onto your SuperPOD account (Automatic1111,ComfyUI, InvokeAI, Fooocus)
### 3. Notice the following ports are used for each model:
  - Automatic1111: 172.0.0.1:**7860**
  - ComfyUI:       172.0.0.1:**8188**
  - InvokeAI:      172.0.0.1:**9090**
  - Fooocus:       172.0.0.1:**7865**
### 4. Setup the model using the following method with 2 opened terminal
#### 4.1. Terminal 1
- ssh to superpod account with Dynamic port number, for example port 8000 and request a compute node:

```bash
$ ssh -C -D 8000 tuev@superpod.smu.edu
$ srun -N 1 -G 1 -c 10 --mem=64gb --time=12:00:00 --pty $SHELL
```
Assume you are given a node name: **bcm-dgxa100-0001**

- Load neccessary libraries:

```bash
$ module load conda gcc cuda cudnn
```

- Activate the conda environment for stable diffusion

```bash
$ conda activate ~/sd
```

- Go to the UI model, for example stable-diffusion-webui for Automatic1111 and run the command:

```bash
$ cd $WORK/stable-diffusion-webui
$ jupyter lab &
$ ./webui.sh & # Note this is changed for each model (ComfyUI, InvokeAI, Fooocus)
```

Leave this terminal 1 going on and open another terminal

#### 4.2. Terminal 2

Now you will need to ssh to the SuperPOD with the Dynamic and Static port and the requested node **bcm-dgxa100-0001**.

```bash
$ ssh -J tuev@superpod.smu.edu tuev@bcm-dgxa100-0001 -L 8000:localhost:8000 -L 7860:localhost:7860
```

Enter password twice with DUO, then you will be logged in a node

#### 4.3. Open your browser that you have already setup the forwarding port to localhost with port 8000

Type in the address 127.0.0.1:7860, you will be able to run Automatic1111.

### Do the same step for other UI model.
