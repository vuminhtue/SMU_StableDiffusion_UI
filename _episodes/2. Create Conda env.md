# 2. Creating the conda environment 

Now it the time to create your own conda environment so that you can get the GPU supported library working for you.
Follow these steps:

### Load neccesary modules with GPU supported library

```bash
$ module load spack conda cuda-11.8.0-gcc-11.2.0/cudnn/8.7.0.84-11.8-aydlfs6 cuda/gcc-11.2.0/cuda/11.8.0-vnha6cm
```

### Create conda environment and name it sd (for stable diffusion), save it on your desktop:

```bash
$ conda create --prefix ~/sd python=3.10.13 pip â€“y
```

activate it once you done creating the environment:

```bash
$ conda activate ~/sd
```
