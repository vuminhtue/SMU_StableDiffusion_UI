The method of using conda environment in SuperPOD is similar to ManeFrame 3. These are the steps:

### 1. Setup your own conda environment in SuperPOD with cuda library supported (refer to my SuperPOD 101 lecture notes)
### 2. Install the Stable Diffusion UI model onto your SuperPOD account (Automatic1111,ComfyUI, InvokeAI, Fooocus)
### 3. Notice the following ports are used for each model:
  - Automatic1111: 172.0.0.1:**7860**
  - ComfyUI:       172.0.0.1:**8188**
