# 8. Install OpenSora to SPOD

- OpenAI Sora is the tool to create video from text.
- OpenAI released Sora on Dec 2024 with the subscription.
- Here we utilize the open source Open-Sora from hpcaitech: https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora
- The following steps instruct you to install it on SMU M3/SPOD to shared folder between them.
- However, as this model consumed a lot of GPU memory, we do not encourage you to run in on M3. So this instruction show you the installation on SPOD instead.
- Note, at the time of writing this instruction cuda/11.8 is recommended with gcc/11 for GPU usage

## 1. Create conda env

Instruction can be found in the source github page: 

```bash
$ module load conda gcc/13 cuda/12 cudnn
$ conda create --prefix /projects/tuev/tuev_work/conda_env/opensora python=3.9 pip --y
$ conda activate /projects/tuev/tuev_work/conda_env/opensora
```
## 2. Clone the github repo to your shared folder and start installing dependencies:

```bash
$ cd /projects/tuev/tuev_work/
$ git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora
$ pip install -r requirements/requirements-cu121.txt
$ pip install -v . # for development mode, `pip install -v -e .`

# Optional
$ pip install packaging ninja
$ pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

# install apex
# set enable_layernorm_kernel=False in config to disable apex
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation --config-settings "--build-option=--cpp_ext" --config-settings "--build-option=--cuda_ext" git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.git
```

## 3. Run the model inference via CLI:

- It is very straightforwad to use LivePortrait in CLI. You just need to give the source image and driving video:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py  --num-frames 2s --resolution 720p --aspect-ratio 9:16 --num-sampling-steps 30 --flow 5 --aes 6.5 --layernorm-kernel False --flash-attn False \
 --prompt "A Japanese tram glides through the snowy streets of a city, its sleek design cutting through the falling snowflakes with grace. The tram's illuminated windows cast a warm glow onto the snowy surroundings, creating a cozy atmosphere inside. Snowflakes dance in the air, swirling around the tram as it moves along its tracks. Outside, the city is blanketed in a layer of snow, transforming familiar streets into a winter wonderland. Cherry blossom trees, now bare, stand quietly along the tram tracks, their branches dusted with snow. People hurry along the sidewalks, bundled up against the cold, while the tram's bell rings softly, announcing its arrival at each stop."
```

- The output can be found from sample folder folder:
